# Drum Lesson Plan

Welcome to the RaylaVR's OpenDrumBook!  This guide is designed to empower music teachers across the world with the resources they need to teach marching percussion to anyone!

This guide is written to be taught like a typical classroom course and will be taught with a similar structure, however it is designed to minimize needless work and give effective practice assignments and processes.
