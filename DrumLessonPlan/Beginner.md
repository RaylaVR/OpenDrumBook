# Beginner

This set of lessons is designed to take a someone with no previous music experience up to being able to play what is required for easy to intermediate marching bass drum music.  It serves as the foundation for all marching percussion and is a prerequisite for all future levels.  It is recommended for middle school and early high school students.

The Beginner Course is divided into two sections which each have a relevant exercise at the end for students to apply their skills.  These are written to be somewhat challenging and serve as good exercises to play in your warm-up sequence.
