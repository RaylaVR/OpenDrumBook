# Lesson I: Hello Drums!

## Introduction

This should introduce what marching drums are and what will be learned in this lesson

## Musical Prerequisites

Teaches the basics of music notation and presents a few examples of how one would go about reading music.  Dynamics defined at their respective heights.

## Playing the Drum for the first time

Goes over the basic mechanics of a drum stroke, the grip, minimum effort theory's application. Wrist-arm-arm-wrist, up-down, repetitive strokes. Do a counted number of strokes then stop.

## 8-8-16 and 8th note reading excersises

Finally, have them read and play 8-8-16 as well as a few random eighth note patterns to teach them to interpretive rhythms.  Natural Sticking should be explained here

## Marking Time 101 and upbeats

## Put it all together

8-8-16 and 8th note reading/timing exercises while marking time

## Quiz:

Quiz them on reading skill and 8-8-16 looking at their technique to make sure that they are using about the right amount of arm/wrist, aren't massivly over/undersqueezing the stick, and using the fulcrum to bounce the stroke. Don't be overly critical with technique as it will be improved upon quickly over the next few lessons.
