# Lesson II: The 4 Stroke Types

Note: Once they are comfortable with marking time from the previous lesson, you should not teach new excersises/concepts without it for the beginner level. It is critical that students develop their sense of time with their feet. If they are struggling with a new concept and the mark time, break down the music into even individual notes with a mark time. Only drop mark time if you are very confident that the whole group could add it back in later.

## **Introduction**

Go over notation, and how it applies to drum music.

## Accents and Taps

Reiterate Full strokes from previous lessons, then introduce taps and have them play what they know with taps instead of accents

## Upstrokes and Down Strokes

Alternate Accents and Taps

## 2 Accent 2 Tap

2 accents then 2 taps sequentially 

## Apply Your Learning

Put accents and taps on to previous 8-8-16 exercises and other eighth note timing
