# Lesson III: Subdivision I

# **16th Notes**

## Further Subdivision

We've learned how to read quarter and 8th notes, so the next logical step is to move down to sixteenth notes.  A sixteenth note consists of half an eighth note's worth of space and is denoted by the second flag on its stem.  Like eighth notes, these stems can be connected to ease the reading process and even combined with eight note stems to form cleaner, readable rhythms.

ToDo:  Add Image of Single 16th note, a grouping of four, and an example of 16th and eighth notes together

We count sixteenth notes by a similar process to eighth notes, with distinct phonetics on each part of the broken down structure.  For sixteenth notes, this is "1 + e + & + a" with the 'e' being pronounced like the letter and the 'a' being said as it would be in the word 'father'.  Note that the '1' and the '&' are placed in exactly the same place as they would be in an eighth note.

ToDo: add image with eighth notes and sixteenth notes showing the way that the counts line up

## 16th Note Timing Exercise (3 Note)

Note the pattern in this exercise, how there are groupings of all sixteenth notes followed by a variation of a sixteenth note grouping.  These are placed before each variation as an aid to help keep time before and after each pattern.  It will let you check yourself with the metronome and your fellow players, which is why we call it a ***check pattern.***  For now we will be focusing on measures 1-8 of the exercise.

### Interpreting the patterns

You'll remember from previous lessons that drums do not have sustaining notes, and that an eighth note followed by an eighth rest will sound the same as a quarter note.  Try to apply this concept to these patterns.  Below are all 4 of the patterns as written in the exercise, try to break them up into individual sixteenth notes and rests with no top bars connecting them.

ToDo:  Add the write out exercise image as well as a key for the instructor to show.

When written out this way, you can see how each pattern is a grouping of 16th notes with a single note removed at each location.

Like with eighth notes, natural sticking occurs on sixteenth notes, however there are four notes instead of just the two in each grouping, which increases the number of note/rest permutations significantly.  16th note timing exercise is designed to work on this concept as well as teach your brain to understand how your feet line up with 16th note rhythms.

## Reading 16th Notes

## Quiz:

Test them on 16th note timing exercise and give a few 16th note pages to look over and play.  Test on accuracy of the timing exercise (especially the mark-time) and on reading ability.
