# OpenDrumBook

A fully open source marching drumline curriculum designed for middle and high school instructors.  It is designed to allow volunteers to teach without the work overhead of writing exercises or coming up with lesson plans.

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS DO NOT USE TO TEACH YET

While I will be activley adding to this and moving it closer and closer to a fully usable teaching tool, at the moment it is nowhere close to that.  Eventually I will have contribution guidelines that will allow others to help with things like the translations, additional exersices, guides for marching etc.  Please bear with me as I am pretty new to TeX and git as a whole as far as actually running a project.
